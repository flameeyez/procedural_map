layers for terrain features?
first animated sprite + pathfinding

noise:
0.01 = slow rise, slow fall
use 0.01 during a mountain pass; capture values over threshold
use 0.01 with a different offset for water? do we want similarly sized mountains and water?
0.05 = fast rise, fast fall
use 0.05 to add vegetation?

caching:
caching to the right should cache the sum of chunks on screen plus the threshold, as the anchor point is the top-left corner of the screen
this leads to holes when scrolling to the right; scrolling to the left is far less affected
